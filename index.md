### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn how to program how many 
    days were left until my birthday. I wrote a program that could calculate the number 
    of days between two dates. I had to use cin and cout functions, as well as call int variables.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn about the names of all 58 counties in California. I found this exercise to be very fun and challenging! For this part of the lab, we were required to create a two-dimensional structure from std::vector to organize California's population data by county.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I learned to program my first animation as a GIF. I had to take advantage of the three RGB color values: Red, Green, and Blue. I was able to combine all three of the channels for each color, which created a really beautiful, gradient GIF.
